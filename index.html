<h2>Inline CSS Example</h2>
<p>Since the default text color for the page is black, the paragraph is black. However, thanks to <span style="color: #FF7A59">inline CSS</span>, I can change the color of a few words within a paragraph to orange to make it really stand out.</p>
<h1 style="background-color:rgb(87, 87, 235);">Hello World</h1>
